A Web Application using Rails to accomplish Asynchronous Planning Poker (APP)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal is to register estimate(in points) and real hours per ticket.
Each ticket belongs to a project and developer who is in charge of maintaining it.
Ticket management must be easy and fast so developers can go back to developing.
So we developed an easy to use and very friendly UI.

There are also reports per team, project or developer.
We are interested mainly in team velocity.
